Debug Plus Plus is a mod for **Balatro** that is meant to ease some common actions when debugging and creating mods. To open and close the main UI, press [TAB] or use the button in the pause menu. (This can be changed in the mod's settings menu)

# FAQ

**How do I open and close the menu?**\
Press [TAB] while in-game, or use the 'DebugPlusPlus' button in the pause menu. (Can be toggled in the mod settings menu).\

**DebugPlus' menu gets stuck when I release [TAB].**\
Hold [TAB] for around 0.2 seconds when opening and closing the menu.\

**There is a weird green box blocking the right side of the screen.**\
Same as above. This is due to a weird interaction with DebugPlus and DebugPlusPlus (this mod).\

**I can change certain card data**\
This is likely because the game is actively changing it back. DebugPlusPlus can't help you in this case.\

**I found a bug/want to suggest a feature.**\
Report/suggest it inside the [dedicated thread](https://discord.com/channels/1116389027176787968/1372508275794513962) in the offical Balatro's discord server.\

# Settings
- **Add DebugPlusPlus pause menu button** - Adds a new button to the pause menu (both in a run and in the main menu) to quickly access DebugPlusPlus.
- **Require to hold Ctrl too to toggle the menu** - Makes so the DebugPusPlus interface can only be toggled while pressing both [TAB] and [CONTROL] at the same time.
- **Open original Debug menu** - Prevents the vanilla debug menu from appearing while holding [TAB].
- **Override overlay menu** - Weather the DebugPlusPlus menu should override already existing overlay menus.
